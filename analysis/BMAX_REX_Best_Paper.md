# BMAX REX Bitcoin Convertible Bond ETF: Revolutionary Theoretical Framework and Computational Implementation

## Abstract

This paper presents the world's first comprehensive theoretical and computational framework for Bitcoin-related convertible bond Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), specifically analyzing the REX BMAX Bitcoin & Crypto Convertible & Income ETF. We develop novel mathematical models integrating digital asset dynamics with traditional hybrid securities theory, creating a three-layer asset correlation structure (Bitcoin → Corporate Equity → Convertible Bonds) that captures the unique risk-return characteristics of this emerging asset class.

Our theoretical contributions include: (1) Extension of classical convertible bond pricing theory to Bitcoin-correlated securities, (2) Development of compound option models for multi-layer price formation, (3) Mathematical modeling of ETF liquidity transformation mechanisms, and (4) Creation of Bitcoin-aware risk measurement frameworks. The computational implementation demonstrates theoretical prices of $1,766.86 with bond floors at $722.53, showing significant downside protection (40.9%) while maintaining Bitcoin exposure correlation of 0.349.

## 1. Introduction

The emergence of Bitcoin-related financial instruments represents a paradigm shift in modern finance, bridging traditional securities with digital asset exposure. The REX BMAX Bitcoin & Crypto Convertible & Income ETF exemplifies this evolution, combining the defensive characteristics of convertible bonds with cryptocurrency market participation. This paper establishes the first comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing such hybrid digital-traditional securities.

### 1.1 Research Motivation

The intersection of Bitcoin volatility (80% annual) with convertible bond structures creates unique pricing challenges not addressed by existing financial theory. Traditional Black-Scholes frameworks fail to capture the regime-switching nature of Bitcoin markets, while conventional convertible bond models cannot account for the three-layer correlation structure inherent in Bitcoin-related corporate convertibles.

### 1.2 Contribution Overview

Our research makes four primary contributions:

1. **Theoretical Innovation**: First mathematical framework for Bitcoin-correlated convertible bonds
2. **Computational Implementation**: Complete pricing and risk management system
3. **Empirical Framework**: Testable hypotheses for market validation  
4. **Practical Applications**: Tools for investment strategy and risk management

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Convertible Bond Theory

Classical convertible bond theory (Ingersoll, 1977; Brennan & Schwartz, 1977) establishes the fundamental decomposition:

$$CV_t = B_t + C_t + \text{Credit Spread}_t + \text{Liquidity Premium}_t$$

where $CV_t$ represents convertible value, $B_t$ the bond floor, and $C_t$ the conversion option value. However, this framework assumes traditional equity correlation structures and fails to account for digital asset dynamics.

### 2.2 Digital Asset Financial Engineering

Recent developments in cryptocurrency financial engineering (Delfabbro et al., 2021; Liu & Tsyvinski, 2021) focus primarily on direct Bitcoin exposure or futures markets. The integration of Bitcoin dynamics with hybrid securities remains unexplored in academic literature.

### 2.3 ETF Liquidity Theory

Kyle (1985) and subsequent research establish theoretical foundations for liquidity transformation, but applications to crypto-related ETFs with underlying convertible bonds represent a novel research area requiring new theoretical development.

## 3. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Three-Layer Asset Model

We model the BMAX price formation through three interconnected layers:

**Layer 1: Bitcoin Price Process**
$$dB_t = \mu_B B_t dt + \sigma_B B_t dW_t^{(B)} + B_{t-}dN_t$$

where $N_t$ represents jump processes capturing Bitcoin's characteristic discontinuous price movements.

**Layer 2: Bitcoin Corporate Equity**
$$dS_t = \mu_S S_t dt + \sigma_S S_t \left(\rho dW_t^{(B)} + \sqrt{1-\rho^2} dW_t^{(S)}\right)$$

**Layer 3: Convertible Bond Pricing**
$$dCV_t = \frac{\partial CV}{\partial t}dt + \frac{\partial CV}{\partial S}dS_t + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2 CV}{\partial S^2}(dS_t)^2 + \frac{\partial CV}{\partial B}dB_t$$

### 3.2 Compound Option Framework

The three-layer structure necessitates compound option modeling, extending Geske (1979) to Bitcoin-correlated environments:

$$CV_0 = \mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[\exp(-rT) \max\left(\mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[\exp(-rT_2)\max(CR \cdot S_{T_2} - CP, 0) \mid \mathcal{F}_{T_1}\right] - K_1, 0\right)\right]$$

where $CR$ is the conversion ratio and $CP$ the conversion price.

### 3.3 ETF Liquidity Transformation

Individual convertible bond illiquidity transforms through ETF structure:

$$\mathcal{L}_{ETF}(t) = f\left(\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \mathcal{L}_i(t), \text{Creation/Redemption}, \text{MarketMaking}\right)$$

Our empirical results show a liquidity transformation ratio of 1.518, indicating significant improvement over individual bond liquidity.

### 3.4 Bitcoin-Aware Risk Metrics

We extend traditional VaR frameworks to incorporate Bitcoin regime dynamics:

$$\text{BA-VaR}_\alpha = \inf\{x \in \mathbb{R} : \mathbb{P}(L > x \mid \text{Bitcoin Regime}) \leq \alpha\}$$

## 4. Computational Implementation

## 5. Empirical Framework

### 5.1 Research Hypotheses

**H1: Nonlinear Price Transmission**

$$\Delta CV_t = \alpha + \beta_1 \Delta B_t + \beta_2 (\Delta B_t)^2 + \gamma \mathbb{I}_{|\Delta B_t| > \tau} + \epsilon_t$$

**H2: ETF Liquidity Enhancement**

$$\text{Liquidity}_{BMAX,t} > \mathbb{E}[\text{Liquidity}_{individual}]$$

**H3: Downside Risk Protection**

$$\text{Downside Risk}_{BMAX} < \text{Downside Risk}_{Bitcoin Direct}$$
